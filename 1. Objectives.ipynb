    "| Question Type | Description | Example |\n",
    "|:-------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|\n",
    "| Descriptive | A question that asks about summarized characteristics of a data set without interpretation (i.e., report a fact). | How many people live in each province and territory in Canada? |\n",
    "| Exploratory | A question that asks if there are patterns, trends, or relationships within a single data set. Often used to propose hypotheses for future study. | Does political party voting change with indicators of wealth in a set of data collected on 2,000 people living in Canada? |\n",
    "| Predictive | A question that asks about predicting measurements or labels for individuals (people or things). The focus is on what things predict some outcome, but not what causes the outcome. | What political party will someone vote for in the next Canadian election? |\n",
    "| Inferential | A question that looks for patterns, trends, or relationships in a single data set and also asks for quantification of how applicable these findings are to the wider population. | Does political party voting change with indicators of wealth for all people living in Canada? |\n",
    "| Causal | A question that asks about whether changing one factor will lead to a change in another factor, on average, in the wider population. | Does wealth lead to voting for a certain political party in Canadian elections? | \n",
    "| Mechanistic | A question that asks about the underlying mechanism of the observed patterns, trends, or relationships (i.e., how does it happen?) | How does wealth lead to voting for a certain political party in Canadian elections?"
